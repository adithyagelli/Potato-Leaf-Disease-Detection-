# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-
Potato Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
In this project, our aim is to develop an effective potato disease detection system utilizing
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on leaf images. Our objectives encompass various
stages of the project, from preprocessing the images to evaluating the model's performance and
considering real-world applicability.
Firstly, our primary objective revolves around disease classification. We seek to train a CNN model
capable of accurately classifying potato leaf images into distinct categories such as late blight, early
blight, or healthy. This entails leveraging the power of deep learning to enable automated and precise
identification of plant diseases, thereby aiding farmers in timely interventions to mitigate crop losses.
To achieve this, we embark on image preprocessing as our second objective. This involves
implementing techniques to enhance the quality and utility of the input images. Techniques such as
resizing, normalization, and augmentation are employed to ensure that the model receives optimal
input, thereby improving its ability to generalize across different datasets.
The third objective centers on model training and evaluation. We train the CNN model using a dataset
comprising labeled potato leaf images, and subsequently evaluate its performance using standard
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This stage is crucial for gauging the
effectiveness of our model and identifying areas for improvement.
In addition to evaluating our model's performance, we also undertake a comparative analysis as our
fourth objective. We compare the performance of our CNN model with other machine learning or
deep learning algorithms commonly used in image classification tasks, such as Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) or traditional CNN architectures.
